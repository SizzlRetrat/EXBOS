# EXBOS
welcome to EXBOS official github page!
all the code is open-source!
this is the HOME version, you CANNOT use for commercial,
EXBOS is an open-source c and batch operating system, this is NOT for use of important files or scams, this is the code
EXBOS SSD's and HDD's are not provided and need to be made
no iso files are set
web browsers must be coded in c or batch to open and run
on the os, look on the apmd sub directory
check all files, if you see the word 'appname' show
the directory of your app =)
all files use c, python, java or batch make sure
your hard drive/device can tell what these mean
and can read these languages, you may need to download
drivers to EXBOS so it runs =) 
I am not bad at coding, its just i thought it would be 
fun to make a grade 1 coding operating system =)
EXBOS is not finished =)
